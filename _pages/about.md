Hi, Welcome to my website! Starting September 2019 I am working in National University of Singapore (NUS) as a research assistant in Institute of Operations Researcha and Analytics (IORA). Currently I am applying for PhD in Operation Researchs and Optimization Theory at 2020 Fall admission. My interest lies in online learning, robust optimization, choice model, and data driven approaches in Operations Research/Management. I am particularly interested in the interdisciplinary research of optimization, machine learning and policy design, hich most my research work are about. Don't hesitate contacting me if you are interested in my background and would like to advice on me.
