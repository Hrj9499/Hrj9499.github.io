excerpt: 'Research work with Professor Teo Chung-Piaw in NUS Business School. We found that the optimization goal of the XGBoost algorithm well matches the conditions of consecutive optimizer. Based on this connection, We purpose a refined XGBoost algorithm that utilize the info from consecutive tree leaves to reduce the over-fitting issue. This algorithm has a O(KT[mn^2+dlogn]) time complexity that is tractable for prediction task of size 10-100K. '

## Abstract
We found that the optimization goal of the XGBoost algorithm well matches the conditions of consecutive optimizer. Based on this connection, We purpose a refined XGBoost algorithm that utilize the info from consecutive tree leaves to reduce the over-fitting issue. This algorithm has a O(KT[mn^2+dlogn]) time complexity that is tractable for prediction task of size 10-100K.
